# Code-Quiz

As I proceed in my career as a web developer, I will most likely be asked to complete a coding assessment, which is typically a combination of multiple-choice questions and interactive challenges. I built a timed code quiz with multiple-choice questions. 

This app will run in your browser and feature dynamically updated HTML and CSS powered by my JavaScript code. It will also feature a clean and polished user interface and be responsive, ensuring that it adapts to multiple screen sizes!
